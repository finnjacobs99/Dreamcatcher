Our app will provide a user with a way to organize all the bucket list items they might have in their life. The user will be able to create different categories for events they want to accomplish. For each event, a user will be able to provide information about that event like; name of event, description, image, priority, and deadline. The user will be able to change the status of different events based on if the event is in progress or has been completed. Users will be able to share their lists with friends and add events from shared lists to your own lists. Users will be able to make collaborative lists with friends and fill these lists with events they want to do together. Users will be able check statistics on their events like how long an event took to complete, how many events are in progress, or how many events they have completed in total.
